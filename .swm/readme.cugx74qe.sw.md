This Terraform file should create an S3 bucket and set up IAM with a user and an inline policy that authorises access to the bucket. After you've set up the bucket, user, and policy, go to the user's AWS dashboard and create an access key. This access key should be used to configure the environment variables in step 3a [here](https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/using-cloud-storage#configuring-aws-s3-bucket-with-techdocs).
